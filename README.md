#Inspiration
I have always been enthralled with the wonder of Virtual Reality. I firmly believe our future will not be a future of materials, things, and possessions. Our future will be one of minimalism and technology. Classrooms are becoming incubators for high-tech learning and physics is no exception. With a completed Laser Susan application, no high school will require a physical physics lab. The money and storage space spent on lab equipment will be a thing of the past. A few VR headsets and a copy of Laser Susan will equip students with a practical knowledge of many staple physics concepts.

#What it does
Currently, Laser Susan has a single application that aims to teach the science of light refraction.

#How I built it
Unity and c#

#Challenges I ran into
The Challenges were numerous. This experience was the first Hackathon I had no team for. It is also the first time I tried to program a VR headset. It was so much fun and also so frustrating.

#Accomplishments that I'm proud of
Learned C# and VR programming for the first time. I worked through many issues on my own with a little guidance from other fabulous people, Hackers and Mentors alike.

#What I learned
The list goes on. If I had to pick one, Object Oriented programming via the Unity workspace was very interesting and probably my favorite thing I did this weekend.

#What's next for Laser Susan
1.) Make harder reflection based puzzles 2.) Add other labs. In VR we are not bound by the same constraints that our physical world imposes. a.) We can code applications that track and display star and planetary movements. b.) an experiment dealing with waves, both linear and traversal c.) an experiment with circuits where students can build their own fully customizable mother boards
